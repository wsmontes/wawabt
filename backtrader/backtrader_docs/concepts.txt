Platform Concepts
This is a collection of some of the concepts of the platform. It tries to gather information bits which can be useful in using the platform.

Before Starting
All mini-code examples assume the following imports are available:


import backtrader as bt
import backtrader.indicators as btind
import backtrader.feeds as btfeeds
Note

An alternative syntax for accessing sub-modules like indicators and feeds:


import backtrader as bt
And then:


thefeed = bt.feeds.OneOfTheFeeds(...)
theind = bt.indicators.SimpleMovingAverage(...)
Data Feeds - Passing them around
The basis of the work with the platform will be done with Strategies. And these will get passed Data Feeds. The platform end user does not need to care about receiving them:

Data Feeds are automagically provided member variables to the strategy in the form of an array and shortcuts to the array positions

Quick preview of a Strategy derived class declaration and running the platform:


class MyStrategy(bt.Strategy):
    params = dict(period=20)

    def __init__(self):

        sma = btind.SimpleMovingAverage(self.datas[0], period=self.params.period)

    ...

cerebro = bt.Cerebro()

...

data = btfeeds.MyFeed(...)
cerebro.adddata(data)

...

cerebro.addstrategy(MyStrategy, period=30)

...
Notice the following:

No *args or **kwargs are being received by the strategy’s __init__ method (they may still be used)

A member variable self.datas exists which is array/list/iterable holding at least one item (hopefully or else an exception will be raised)

So it is. Data Feeds get added to the platform and they will show up inside the strategy in the sequential order in which they were added to the system.

Note

This also applies to Indicators, should the end user develop his own custom Indicator or when having a look at the source code for some of the existing Indicator Reference

Shortcuts for Data Feeds
The self.datas array items can be directly accessed with additional automatic member variables:

self.data targets self.datas[0]

self.dataX targets self.datas[X]

The example then:


class MyStrategy(bt.Strategy):
    params = dict(period=20)

    def __init__(self):

        sma = btind.SimpleMovingAverage(self.data, period=self.params.period)

    ...
Omitting the Data Feeds
The example above can be further simplified to:


class MyStrategy(bt.Strategy):
    params = dict(period=20)

    def __init__(self):

        sma = btind.SimpleMovingAverage(period=self.params.period)

    ...
self.data has been completely removed from the invocation of SimpleMovingAverage. If this is done, the indicator (in this case the SimpleMovingAverage) receives the first data of the object in which is being created (the Strategy), which is self.data (aka self.data0 or self.datas[0])

Almost everything is a Data Feed
Not only Data Feeds are data and can be passed around. Indicators and results of Operations are also data.

In the previous example the SimpleMovingAverage was receiving self.datas[0] as input to operate on. An example with operations and extra indicators:


class MyStrategy(bt.Strategy):
    params = dict(period1=20, period2=25, period3=10, period4)

    def __init__(self):

        sma1 = btind.SimpleMovingAverage(self.datas[0], period=self.p.period1)

        # This 2nd Moving Average operates using sma1 as "data"
        sma2 = btind.SimpleMovingAverage(sma1, period=self.p.period2)

        # New data created via arithmetic operation
        something = sma2 - sma1 + self.data.close

        # This 3rd Moving Average operates using something  as "data"
        sma3 = btind.SimpleMovingAverage(something, period=self.p.period3)

        # Comparison operators work too ...
        greater = sma3 > sma1

        # Pointless Moving Average of True/False values but valid
        # This 4th Moving Average operates using greater  as "data"
        sma3 = btind.SimpleMovingAverage(greater, period=self.p.period4)

    ...
Basically everything gets transformed into an object which can be used as a data feed once it has been operated upon.

Parameters
Mostly every other class in the platform supports the notion of parameters.

Parameters along with default values are declared as a class attribute (tuple of tuples or dict-like object)

Keywords args (**kwargs) are scanned for matching parameters, removing them from **kwargs if found and assigning the value to the corresponding parameter

And parameters can be finally used in instances of the class by accessing the member variable self.params (shorthand: self.p)

The previous quick Strategy preview already contains a parameters example, but for the sake of redundancy, again, focusing only on the parameters. Using tuples:


class MyStrategy(bt.Strategy):
    params = (('period', 20),)

    def __init__(self):
        sma = btind.SimpleMovingAverage(self.data, period=self.p.period)
And using a dict:


class MyStrategy(bt.Strategy):
    params = dict(period=20)

    def __init__(self):
        sma = btind.SimpleMovingAverage(self.data, period=self.p.period)
Lines
Again mostly every other object in the platform is a Lines enabled object. From a end user point of view this means:

It can hold one of more line series, being a line series an array of values were the values put together in a chart they would form a line.
A good example of a line (or lineseries) is the line formed by the closing prices of a stock. This is actually a well-known chart representation of the evolution of prices (known as Line on Close)

Regular use of the platform is only concerned with accessing lines. The previous mini-strategy example, lightly extended, comes in handy again:


class MyStrategy(bt.Strategy):
    params = dict(period=20)

    def __init__(self):

        self.movav = btind.SimpleMovingAverage(self.data, period=self.p.period)

    def next(self):
        if self.movav.lines.sma[0] > self.data.lines.close[0]:
            print('Simple Moving Average is greater than the closing price')
Two objects with lines have been exposed:

self.data It has a lines attribute which contains a close attribute in turn

self.movav which is a SimpleMovingAverage indicator It has a lines attribute which contains a sma attribute in turn

Note

It should be obvious from this, that lines are named. They can also be accessed sequentially following the declaration order, but this should only be used in Indicator development

And both lines, namely close and sma can be queried for a point (index 0) to compare the values.

Shorthand access to lines do exist:

xxx.lines can be shortened to xxx.l

xxx.lines.name can be shortened to xxx.lines_name

Complex objects like Strategies and Indicators offer quick access to data’s lines

self.data_name offers a direct access to self.data.lines.name

Which also applies to the numbered data variables: self.data1_name -> self.data1.lines.name

Additionally the line names are directly accessible with:

self.data.close and self.movav.sma

But the notation doesn’t make as clear as the previous one if lines are actually being accessed.

Not

Setting/Assigning the lines with these two later notations is not supported

Lines declaration
If an Indicator is being developed, the lines which the indicator has must be declared.

Just as with params this takes place as a class attribute this time ONLY as a tuple. Dictionaries are not supported because they do not store things following insertion order.

For the Simple Moving Average it would be done like this:


class SimpleMovingAverage(Indicator):
    lines = ('sma',)

    ...
Note

The comma following the declaration is needed in tuples if you pass a single string to the tuple or else each letter in the string would be interpreted as an item to be added to the tuple. Possibly one of the few spots where Python’s syntax got it wrong.

As seen in the previous example this declaration creates a sma line in the Indicator that can be later accessed in the Strategy’s logic (and possibly by other indicators to create more complex indicators)

For development is sometimes useful to access the lines in a generic non-named manner and this is where numbered access comes in handy:

self.lines[0] points to self.lines.sma
Had more lines been defined they would be accessed with index 1, 2, and higher.

And of course, extra shorthand versions do exist:

self.line points to self.lines[0]

self.lineX point to self.lines[X]

self.line_X point to self.lines[X]

Inside objects which are receiving datas feeds the lines below these data feeds can also be quickly accessed by number:

self.dataY points to self.data.lines[Y]

self.dataX_Y points to self.dataX.lines[X] which is a full shorthard version of self.datas[X].lines[Y]

Accessing lines in Data Feeds
Inside data feeds the lines can also be accessed omitting the lines. This makes it more natural to work with thinks like close prices.

For example:


data = btfeeds.BacktraderCSVData(dataname='mydata.csv')

...

class MyStrategy(bt.Strategy):

    ...

    def next(self):

        if self.data.close[0] > 30.0:
            ...
Which seems more natural than the also valid: if self.data.lines.close[0] > 30.0:. The same doesn’t apply to Indicators with the reasoning being:

An Indicator could have an attribute close which holds an intermediate calculation, which is later delivered to the actual lines also named close
In the case of Data Feeds, no calculation takes place, because it is only a data source.

Lines len
Lines have a set of points and grow dynamically during execution, therefore the length can be measured at any time by invoking the standard Python len function.

This applies to for example:

Data Feeds

Strategies

Indicators

An additional property applies to Data Feeds when the data is preloaded:

Method buflen
The method returns the actual number of bars the Data Feed has available.

The difference between len and buflen

len reports how many bars have been processed

buflen reports the total number of bars which have been loaded for the Data Feed

If both return the same value, either no data has been preloaded or the processing of bars has consumed all preloaded bars (and unless the system is connected to a live feed, this will mean the end of processing)

Inheritance of Lines and Params
A kind of metalanguage is in place to support declaration of Params and Lines. Every effort has been made to make it compatible with standard Python inheritance rules.

Params inheritance
Inheritance should work as expected:

Multiple inheritance is supported

Params from base classes are inherited

If multiple base classes define the same param the default value of the last class in the inheritance list is used

If the same param is redefined in a child class, the new default value takes over that of the base class

Lines Inheritance
Multiple inheritance is supported

Lines from all base classes are inherited. Being named lines there will only be one version of a line if the same name has been used more than once in base classes

Indexing: 0 and -1
Lines as seen before are line series and have a set of points that conform a line when drawn together (like when joining all closing prices together along a time axis)

To access those points in regular code, the choice has been to use a 0 based approach for the current get/set instant.

Strategies do only get values. Indicators do also set values.

From the previous quick strategy example where the next method was briefly seen:


def next(self):
    if self.movav.lines.sma[0] > self.data.lines.close[0]:
        print('Simple Moving Average is greater than the closing price')
The logic is getting the current value of the moving average and the current closing price by applying index 0.

Note

Actually for index 0 and when applying logic/arithmetic operators the comparison can be made directly as in:


if self.movav.lines.sma > self.data.lines.close:
    ...
See later in the document the explanation for operators.

Setting is meant to be used when developing, for example, an Indicator, because the current output value has to be set by the indicator.

A SimpleMovingAverage can be calculated for the current get/set point as follows:


def next(self):
  self.line[0] = math.fsum(self.data.get(0, size=self.p.period)) / self.p.period
Accessing previous set points has been modeled following the definition Python makes for -1 when accessing an array/iterable

It points to the last item of the array
The platform consider the last set item (before the current live get/set point) to be -1.

As such comparing the current close to the previous close is a 0 vs -1 thing. In a strategy, for example:


def next(self):
    if self.data.close[0] > self.data.close[-1]:
        print('Closing price is higher today')
Of course and logically, prices set before -1 will be accessed with -2, -3, ....

Slicing
backtrader doesn’t support slicing for lines objects and this is a design decision following the [0] and [-1] indexing scheme. With regular indexable Python objects you would do things like:


myslice = self.my_sma[0:]  # slice from the beginning til the end
But remember that with the choice for 0 … it is actually the currently delivered value, there is nothing after it. Also:


myslice = self.my_sma[0:-1]  # slice from the beginning til the end
Again … 0 is the current value and -1 is the latest (previous) delivered value. That’s why a slice from 0 -> -1 makes no sense in the backtrader ecosystem.

If slicing were ever to be supported, it would look like:


myslice = self.my_sma[:0]  # slice from current point backwards to the beginning
or:


myslice = self.my_sma[-1:0]  # last value and current value
or:


myslice = self.my_sma[-3:-1]  # from last value backwards to the 3rd last value
Getting a slice
An array with the latest values can still be gotten. The syntax:


myslice = self.my_sma.get(ago=0, size=1)  # default values shown
That would have returned an arry with 1 value (size=1) with the current moment 0 as the staring point to look backwards.

To get 10 values from the current point in time (i.e.: the last 10 values):


myslice = self.my_sma.get(size=10)  # ago defaults to 0
Of course the array has the ordering you would expect. The leftmost value is the oldest one and the rightmost value is the most current (it is a regular python array and not a lines object)

To get the last 10 values skipping only the current point:


myslice = self.my_sma.get(ago=-1, size=10)
Lines: DELAYED indexing
The [] operator syntax is there to extract individual values during the next logic phase. Lines objects support an additional notation to address values through a delayed lines object during the __init__ phase.

Let’s say that the interest in the logic is to compare the previous close value to the actual value of a simple moving average. Rather than doing it manually in each next iteration a pre-canned lines object can be generated:


class MyStrategy(bt.Strategy):
    params = dict(period=20)

    def __init__(self):

        self.movav = btind.SimpleMovingAverage(self.data, period=self.p.period)
        self.cmpval = self.data.close(-1) > self.sma

    def next(self):
        if self.cmpval[0]:
            print('Previous close is higher than the moving average')
Here the (delay) notation is being used:

This delivers a replica of the close prices but delayed by -1.

And the comparison self.data.close(-1) > self.sma generates another lines object which returns either 1 if the condition is True or 0 if False

Lines Coupling
The operator () can be used as shown above with delay value to provide a delayed version of a lines object.

If the syntax is used WITHOUT providing a delay value, then a LinesCoupler lines object is returned. This is meant to establish a coupling between indicators that operate on datas with different timeframes.

Data Feeds with different timeframes have different lengths, and the indicators operating on them replicate the length of the data. Example:

A daily data feed has around 250 bars per year

A weekly data feed has 52 bars per year

Trying to create an operation (for example) which compares 2 simple moving averages, each operating on the datas quoted above would break. It would be unclear how to match the 250 bars from the daily timeframe to the 52 bars of the weekly timeframe.

The reader could imagine a date comparison taking place in the background to find out a day - week correspondence, but:

Indicators are just mathematical formulas and have no datetime information

They know nothing about the environment, just that if the data provides enough values, a calculation can take place.

The () (empty call) notation comes to the rescue:


class MyStrategy(bt.Strategy):
    params = dict(period=20)

    def __init__(self):

        # data0 is a daily data
        sma0 = btind.SMA(self.data0, period=15)  # 15 days sma
        # data1 is a weekly data
        sma1 = btind.SMA(self.data1, period=5)  # 5 weeks sma

        self.buysig = sma0 > sma1()

    def next(self):
        if self.buysig[0]:
            print('daily sma is greater than weekly sma1')
Here the larger timeframe indicator, sma1 is coupled to the daily timeframe with sma1(). This returns an object which is compatible with the larger numbers of bars of sma0 and copies the values produced by sma1, effectively spreading the 52 weekly bars in 250 daily bars

Operators, using natural constructs
In order to achieve the “ease of use” goal the platform allows (within the constraints of Python) the use of operators. And to further enhance this goal , the use of operators has been broken in two stages.

Stage 1 - Operators Create Objects
An example has already been seen even if not explicitly meant for this. During the initialization phase (__init__ method) of objects like Indicators and Strategies, operators create objects that can be operated upon, assigned or kept as reference for later using during the evaluation phase of the Strategy’s logic.

Once again a potential implementation of a SimpleMovingAverage, further broken down into steps.

The code inside the SimpleMovingAverage indicator __init__ could look like:


def __init__(self):
    # Sum N period values - datasum is now a *Lines* object
    # that when queried with the operator [] and index 0
    # returns the current sum

    datasum = btind.SumN(self.data, period=self.params.period)

    # datasum (being *Lines* object although single line) can be
    # naturally divided by an int/float as in this case. It could
    # actually be divided by anothr *Lines* object.
    # The operation returns an object assigned to "av" which again
    # returns the current average at the current instant in time
    # when queried with [0]

    av = datasum / self.params.period

    # The av *Lines* object can be naturally assigned to the named
    # line this indicator delivers. Other objects using this
    # indicator will have direct access to the calculation

    self.line.sma = av
A more complete use case is shown during the initialization of a Strategy:


class MyStrategy(bt.Strategy):

    def __init__(self):

        sma = btind.SimpleMovinAverage(self.data, period=20)

        close_over_sma = self.data.close > sma
        sma_dist_to_high = self.data.high - sma

        sma_dist_small = sma_dist_to_high < 3.5

        # Unfortunately "and" cannot be overridden in Python being
        # a language construct and not an operator and thus a
        # function has to be provided by the platform to emulate it

        sell_sig = bt.And(close_over_sma, sma_dist_small)
After the above operations have taken place, sell_sig is a Lines object which can be later used in the logic of the Strategy, indicating if the conditions are met or not.

Stage 2 - Operators true to nature
Let’s first remember that a strategy has a next method which is called for every bar the system processes. This is where operators are actually in the stage 2 mode. Building on the previous example:


class MyStrategy(bt.Strategy):

    def __init__(self):

        self.sma = sma = btind.SimpleMovinAverage(self.data, period=20)

        close_over_sma = self.data.close > sma
        self.sma_dist_to_high = self.data.high - sma

        sma_dist_small = sma_dist_to_high < 3.5

        # Unfortunately "and" cannot be overridden in Python being
        # a language construct and not an operator and thus a
        # function has to be provided by the platform to emulate it

        self.sell_sig = bt.And(close_over_sma, sma_dist_small)

    def next(self):

        # Although this does not seem like an "operator" it actually is
        # in the sense that the object is being tested for a True/False
        # response

        if self.sma > 30.0:
            print('sma is greater than 30.0')

        if self.sma > self.data.close:
            print('sma is above the close price')

        if self.sell_sig:  # if sell_sig == True: would also be valid
            print('sell sig is True')
        else:
            print('sell sig is False')

        if self.sma_dist_to_high > 5.0:
            print('distance from sma to hig is greater than 5.0')
Not a very useful strategy, just an example. During Stage 2 operators return the expected values (boolean if testing for truth and floats if comparing them to floats) and also arithmetic operations do.

Note

Notice that comparisons are actually not using the [] operator. This is meant to further simplify things.

if self.sma > 30.0: … compares self.sma[0] to 30.0 (1st line and current value)

if self.sma > self.data.close: … compares self.sma[0] to self.data.close[0]

Some non-overriden operators/functions
Python will not allow overriding everything and thus some functions are provided to cope with the cases.

Note

Only meant to be used during Stage 1, to create objects which later provide values.

Operators:

and -> And

or -> Or

Logic Control:

if -> If
Functions:

any -> Any

all -> All

cmp -> Cmp

max -> Max

min -> Min

sum -> Sum

Sum actually uses math.fsum as the underlying operation because the platform works with floating point numbers and applying a regular sum may have an impact on precision.

reduce -> Reduce

These utility operators/functions operate on iterables. The elements in the iterables can be regular Python numeric types (ints, floats, …) and also objects with Lines.

An example generating a very dumb buy signal:


class MyStrategy(bt.Strategy):

    def __init__(self):

        sma1 = btind.SMA(self.data.close, period=15)
        self.buysig = bt.And(sma1 > self.data.close, sma1 > self.data.high)

    def next(self):
        if self.buysig[0]:
            pass  # do something here
It is obvious that if the sma1 is higher than the high, it must be higher than the close. But the point is illustrating the use of bt.And.

Using bt.If:


class MyStrategy(bt.Strategy):

    def __init__(self):

        sma1 = btind.SMA(self.data.close, period=15)
        high_or_low = bt.If(sma1 > self.data.close, self.data.low, self.data.high)
        sma2 = btind.SMA(high_or_low, period=15)
Breakdown:

Generate a SMA on data.close of period=15

And then

bt.If the value of the sma is larger than close, return low, else return high
Remember that no actual value is being returned when bt.If is being invoked. It returns a Lines object which is just like a SimpleMovingAverage.

The values will be calculated later when the system runs

The generated bt.If Lines object is then fed to a 2nd SMA which will sometimes use the low prices and sometimes the high prices for the calculation

Those functions take also numeric values. The same example with a modification:


class MyStrategy(bt.Strategy):

    def __init__(self):

        sma1 = btind.SMA(self.data.close, period=15)
        high_or_30 = bt.If(sma1 > self.data.close, 30.0, self.data.high)
        sma2 = btind.SMA(high_or_30, period=15)
Now the 2nd moving average uses either 30.0 or the high prices to perform the calculation, depending on the logic status of sma vs close

Note

The value 30 is transformed internally into a pseudo-iterable which always returns 30

Line Iterators
To engage into operations, the plaftorm uses the notion of line iterators. They have been loosely modeled after Python’s iterators but have actually nothing to do with them.

Strategies and Indicators are line iterators.

The line iterator concept tries to describe the following:

A Line Iterator kicks slave line iterators telling them to iterate

A Line Iterator then iterates over its own declared named lines setting values

The key to iteration, just like with regular Python iterators, is:

The next method

It will be called for each iteration. The datas array which the line iterator has and serve as basis for logic/calculations will have already been moved to the next index by the platform (barring data replay)

Called when the minimum period for the line iterator has been met. A bit more on this below.

But because they are not regular iterators, two additional methods exist:

prenext

Called before the minimum period for the line iterator` has been met.

nextstart

Called exactly ONCE when the minimum period for the line iterator` has been met.

The default behavior is to forward the call to next, but can of course be overriden if needed.

Extra methods for Indicators
To speed up operations, Indicators support a batch operation mode which has been termed as runonce. It is not strictly needed (a next method suffices) but it greatly reduces time.

The runonce methods rules void the get/set point with index 0 and relies on direct access to the underlying arrays holding the data and being passed the right indices for each state.

The defined methods follow the naming of the next family:

once(self, start, end)

Called when the minimum period has been met. The internal array must be processed between start and end which are zero based from the start of the internal array

preonce(self, start, end)

Called before the minimum period has been met.

oncestart(self, start, end)

Called exactly ONCE when the minimum period has been met.

The default behavior is to forward the call to once, but can of course be overriden if needed.

Minimum Period
A picture is worth a thousand words and in this case possibly an example too. A SimpleMovingAverage is capable of explaining it:


class SimpleMovingAverage(Indicator):
    lines = ('sma',)
    params = dict(period=20)

    def __init__(self):
        ...  # Not relevant for the explanation

    def prenext(self):
        print('prenext:: current period:', len(self))

    def nextstart(self):
        print('nextstart:: current period:', len(self))
        # emulate default behavior ... call next
        self.next()

    def next(self):
        print('next:: current period:', len(self))
And the instantiation could look like:


sma = btind.SimpleMovingAverage(self.data, period=25)
Briefly explained:

Assuming the data passed to the moving average is a standard data feed its default period is 1 that is: the data feed produces a bar with no initial delay.

Then the “period=25” instantiated moving average would have its methods called as follows:

prenext 24 times

nextstart 1 time (in turn calling next)

next n additional times until the data feed has been exhausted

Let’s go for the killer indicator: a SimpleMovingAverage over another SimpleMovingAverage. The instantiation could look like:


sma1 = btind.SimpleMovingAverage(self.data, period=25)

sma2 = btind.SimpleMovingAverage(sma1, period=20)
What now goes on:

The same as above for sma1

sma2 is receiving a data feed which has a minimum period of 25 which is our sma1 and therefore

The sma2 methods are called as indicated:

prenext the first 25 + 18 times for a total of 43 times

25 times to let sma1 produce its 1st sensible value

18 times to accumulate extra sma1 values

For a total of 19 values (1 after 25 calls and then 18 more)

nextstart then 1 time (in turn calling next)

next the n additional times until the data feed has been exhausted

The platform is calling next when the system has already processed 44 bars.

The minimum period has been automatically adjusted to the incoming data.

Strategies and Indicators adhere to this behavior:

Only when the automatically calculated minimum period has been reached will next be called (barring the initial hook call to nextstart)
Note

The same rules apply to preonce, oncestart and once for the runonce batch operation mode

Note

The minimum period behavior can be manipulated although it’s not recommended. Should it be wished used the setminperiod(minperiod) method in either Strategies or Indicators

Up and Running
Getting up and running involves at least 3 Lines objects:

A Data feed

A Strategy (actually a class derived from Strategy)

A Cerebro (brain in Spanish)

Data Feeds
These objects, obviously, provide the data which will be backtested by applying calculations (direct and/or with Indicators)

The platform provides several data feeds:

Several CSV Format and a Generic CSV reader

Yahoo online fetcher

Support for receiving Pandas DataFrames and blaze objects

Live Data Feeds with Interacive Brokers, Visual Chart and Oanda

The platform makes no assumption about the content of the data feed such as timeframe and compression. Those values, together with a name, can be supplied for informational purposes and advance operations like Data Feed Resampling (turning a for example a 5 minute Data Feed into a Daily Data Feed)

Example of setting up a Yahoo Finance Data Feed:


import backtrader as bt
import backtrader.feeds as btfeeds

...

datapath = 'path/to/your/yahoo/data.csv'

data = btfeeds.YahooFinanceCSVData(
    dataname=datapath,
    reversed=True)
The optional reversed parameter for Yahoo is shown, because the CSV files directly downloaded from Yahoo start with the latest date, rather than with the oldest.

If your data spans a large time range, the actual loaded data can be limited as follows:


data = btfeeds.YahooFinanceCSVData(
    dataname=datapath,
    reversed=True
    fromdate=datetime.datetime(2014, 1, 1),
    todate=datetime.datetime(2014, 12, 31))
Both the fromdate and the todate will be included if present in the data feed.

As already mentioned timeframe, compression and name can be added:


data = btfeeds.YahooFinanceCSVData(
    dataname=datapath,
    reversed=True
    fromdate=datetime.datetime(2014, 1, 1),
    todate=datetime.datetime(2014, 12, 31)
    timeframe=bt.TimeFrame.Days,
    compression=1,
    name='Yahoo'
   )
If the data is plotted, those values will be used.

A Strategy (derived) class
Note

Before going on and for a more simplified approach, please check the Signals section of the documentation if subclassing a strategy is not wished.

The goal of anyone using the platform is backtesting the data and this is done inside a Strategy (derived class).

There are 2 methods which at least need customization:

__init__

next

During initialization indicators on data and other calculations are created prepared to later apply the logic.

The next method is later called to apply the logic for each and every bar of the data.

Note

If data feeds of different timeframes (and thus different bar counts) are passed the next method will be called for the master data (the 1st one passed to cerebro, see below) which must be the the data with the smaller timeframe

Note

If the Data Replay functionality is used, the next method will be called several time for the same bar as the development of the bar is replayed.

A basic Strategy derived class:


class MyStrategy(bt.Strategy):

    def __init__(self):

        self.sma = btind.SimpleMovingAverage(self.data, period=20)

    def next(self):

        if self.sma > self.data.close:
            self.buy()

        elif self.sma < self.data.close:
            self.sell()
Strategies have other methods (or hook points) which can be overriden:


class MyStrategy(bt.Strategy):

    def __init__(self):

        self.sma = btind.SimpleMovingAverage(self.data, period=20)

    def next(self):

        if self.sma > self.data.close:
            submitted_order = self.buy()

        elif self.sma < self.data.close:
            submitted_order = self.sell()

    def start(self):
        print('Backtesting is about to start')

    def stop(self):
        print('Backtesting is finished')

    def notify_order(self, order):
        print('An order new/changed/executed/canceled has been received')
The start and stop methods should be self-explanatory. As expected and following the text in the print function, the notify_order method will be called when the strategy needs a notification. Use case:

A buy or sell is requested (as seen in next)

buy/sell will return an order which is submitted to the broker. Keeping a reference to this submitted order is up to the caller.

It can for example be used to ensure that no new orders are submitted if an order is still pending.

If the order is Accepted/Executed/Canceled/Changed the broker will notify the status change (and for example execution size) back to the strategy via the notify method

The QuickStart guide has a complete and functional example of order management in the notify_order method.

More can be done with other Strategy classes:

buy / sell / close

Use the underlying broker and sizer to send the broker a buy/sell order

The same could be done by manually creating an Order and passing it over to the broker. But the platform is about making it easy for those using it.

close will get the current market position and close it immediately.

getposition (or the property “position”)

Returns the current market position

setsizer/getsizer (or the property “sizer”)

These allow setting/getting the underlying stake Sizer. The same logic can be checked against Sizers which provide different stakes for the same situation (fixed size, proportional to capital, exponential)

There is plenty of literature but Van K. Tharp has excellent books on the subject.

A Strategy is a Lines object and these support parameters, which are collected using the standard Python kwargs argument:


class MyStrategy(bt.Strategy):

    params = (('period', 20),)

    def __init__(self):

        self.sma = btind.SimpleMovingAverage(self.data, period=self.params.period)

    ...
    ...
Notice how the SimpleMovingAverage is no longer instantiated with a fixed value of 20, but rather with the parameter “period” which has been defined for the strategy.

A Cerebro
Once Data Feeds are available and the Strategy has been defined, a Cerebro instance is what brings everything together and execute the actions. Instantiating one is easy:


cerebro = bt.Cerebro()
Defaults are taking care of if nothing special is wished.

A default broker is created

No commission for the operations

Data Feeds will be preloaded

The default execution mode will be runonce (batch operation) which is the faster

All indicators must support the runonce mode for full speed. The ones included in the platform do.

Custom indicators do not need to implement the runonce functionality. Cerebro will simulate it, which means those non-runonce compatible indicators will run slower. But still most of the system will run in batch mode.

Since a Data feed is already available and a Strategy too (created earlier) the standard way to put it all together and get it up and running is:


cerebro.adddata(data)
cerebro.addstrategy(MyStrategy, period=25)
cerebro.run()
Notice the following:

The Data Feed “instance” is added

The MyStrategy “class” is added along with parameters (kwargs) that will be passed to it.

The instantiation of MyStrategy will be done by cerebro in the background and any kwargs in “addstrategy” will be passed to it

The user may add as many Strategies and Data Feeds as wished. How Strategies communicate with each other to achieve coordination (if wished be) is not enforced/restricted by the platform.

Of course a Cerebro offers additional possibilities:

Decide about preloading and operation mode:


cerebro = bt.Cerebro(runonce=True, preload=True)
There is a constraint here: runonce needs preloading (if not, a batch operation cannot be run) Of course preloading Data Feeds does not enforce runonce

setbroker / getbroker (and the broker property)

A custom broker can be set if wished. The actual broker instance can also be accesed

Plotting. In a regular case as easy as:


cerebro.run()
cerebro.plot()
plot takes some arguments for the customization

numfigs=1

If the plot is too dense it may be broken down into several plots

plotter=None

A customer plotter instance can be passed and cerebro will not instantiate a default one

**kwargs - standard keyword arguments

Which will get passed to the plotter.

Please see the plotting section for more information.

Optimization of strategies.

As mentioned above, Cerebro gets a Strategy derived class (not an instance) and the keyword arguments that will be passed to it upon instantiation, which will happen when “run” is called.

This is so to enable optimization. The same Strategy class will be instantiated as many times as needed with new parameters. If an instance had been passed to cerebro … this would not be possible.

Optimization is requested as follows:


cerebro.optstrategy(MyStrategy, period=xrange(10, 20))
The method optstrategy has the same signature as addstrategy but does extra housekeeping to ensure optimization runs as expected. A strategy could be expecting a range as a normal parameter for a strategy and addstrategy will make no assumptions about the passed parameter.

On the other hand, optstrategy will understand that an iterable is a set of values that has to be passed in sequence to each instantiation of the Strategy class.

Notice that instead of a single value a range of values is passed. In this simple case 10 values 10 -> 19 (20 is the upper limit) will be tried for this strategy.

If a more complex strategy is developed with extra parameters they can all be passed to optstrategy. Parameters which must not undergo optimization can be passed directly without the end user having to create a dummy iterable of just one value. Example:


cerebro.optstrategy(MyStrategy, period=xrange(10, 20), factor=3.5)
The optstrategy method sees factor and creates (a needed) dummy iterable in the background for factor which has a single element (in the example 3.5)

Note

Interactive Python shells and some types of frozen executables under Windows have problems with the Python multiprocessing module

Please read the Python documentation about multiprocessing.
