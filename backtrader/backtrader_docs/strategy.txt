Strategy
A Cerebro instance is the pumping heart and controlling brain of backtrader. A Strategy is the same for the platform user.

The Strategy’s expressed lifecycle in methods

Note

A strategy can be interrupted during birth by raising a StrategySkipError exception from the module backtrader.errors

This will avoid going through the strategy during a backtesting. See the section Exceptions

Conception: __init__

This is obviously invoked during instantiation: indicators will be created here and other needed attribute. Example:


def __init__(self):
    self.sma = btind.SimpleMovingAverage(period=15)
Birth: start

The world (cerebro) tells the strategy is time to start kicking. A default empty method exists.

Childhood: prenext

indicators declared during conception will have put constraints on how long the strategy needs to mature: this is called the minimum period. Above __init__ created a SimpleMovingAverage with a period=15.

As long as the system has seen less than 15 bars, prenext will be called (the default implementation is a no-op)

Adulthood: next

Once the system has seen 15 bars and the SimpleMovingAverage has a buffer large enough to start producing values, the strategy is mature enough to really execute.

There is a nextstart method which is called exactly once, to mark the switch from prenext to next. The default implementation of nextstart is to simply call next

Reproduction: None

Ok, strategies do not really reproduce. But in a sense they do, because the system will instantiate them several times if optimizing (with different parameters)

Death: stop

The system tells the strategy the time to come to a reset and put things in order has come. A default empty method exists.

In most cases and for regular usage patterns this will look like:


class MyStrategy(bt.Strategy):

    def __init__(self):
        self.sma = btind.SimpleMovingAverage(period=15)

    def next(self):
        if self.sma > self.data.close:
            # Do something
            pass

        elif self.sma < self.data.close:
            # Do something else
            pass
In this snippet:

During __init__ an attribute is assigned an indicator

The default empty start method is not overriden

prenext and nexstart are not overriden

In next the value of the indicator is compared against the closing price to do something

The default empty stop method is not overriden

Strategies, like a trader in the real world, will get notified when events take place. Actually once per next cycle in the backtesting process. The strategy will:

be notified through notify_order(order) of any status change in an order

be notified through notify_trade(trade) of any opening/updating/closing trade

be notified through notify_cashvalue(cash, value) of the current cash and portfolio in the broker

be notified through notify_fund(cash, value, fundvalue, shares) of the current cash and portfolio in the broker and tradking of fundvalue and shares

Events (implementation specific) via notify_store(msg, *args, **kwargs)

See Cerebro for an explanation on the store notifications. These will delivered to the strategy even if they have also been delivered to a cerebro instance (with an overriden notify_store method or via a callback)

And Strategies also like traders have the chance to operate in the market during the next method to try to achieve profit with

the buy method to go long or reduce/close a short position

the sell method to go short or reduce/close a long position

the close method to obviously close an existing position

the cancel method to cancel a not yet executed order

How to Buy/Sell/Close
The Buy and Sell methods generate orders. When invoked they return an Order (or subclass) instance that can be used as a reference. This order has a unique ref identifier that can be used for comparison

Note

Subclasses of Order for speficic broker implementations may carry additional unique identifiers provided by the broker.

To create the order use the following parameters:

data (default: None)

For which data the order has to be created. If None then the first data in the system, self.datas[0] or self.data0 (aka self.data) will be used

size (default: None)

Size to use (positive) of units of data to use for the order.

If None the sizer instance retrieved via getsizer will be used to determine the size.

price (default: None)

Price to use (live brokers may place restrictions on the actual format if it does not comply to minimum tick size requirements)

None is valid for Market and Close orders (the market determines the price)

For Limit, Stop and StopLimit orders this value determines the trigger point (in the case of Limit the trigger is obviously at which price the order should be matched)

plimit (default: None)

Only applicable to StopLimit orders. This is the price at which to set the implicit Limit order, once the Stop has been triggered (for which price has been used)

exectype (default: None)

Possible values:

Order.Market or None. A market order will be executed with the next available price. In backtesting it will be the opening price of the next bar

Order.Limit. An order which can only be executed at the given price or better

Order.Stop. An order which is triggered at price and executed like an Order.Market order

Order.StopLimit. An order which is triggered at price and executed as an implicit Limit order with price given by pricelimit

valid (default: None)

Possible values:

None: this generates an order that will not expire (aka Good til cancel) and remain in the market until matched or canceled. In reality brokers tend to impose a temporal limit, but this is usually so far away in time to consider it as not expiring

datetime.datetime or datetime.date instance: the date will be used to generate an order valid until the given datetime (aka good til date)

Order.DAY or 0 or timedelta(): a day valid until the End of the Session (aka day order) will be generated

numeric value: This is assumed to be a value corresponding to a datetime in matplotlib coding (the one used by backtrader) and will used to generate an order valid until that time (good til date)

tradeid (default: 0)

This is an internal value applied by backtrader to keep track of overlapping trades on the same asset. This tradeid is sent back to the strategy when notifying changes to the status of the orders.

**kwargs: additional broker implementations may support extra parameters. backtrader will pass the kwargs down to the created order objects

Example: if the 4 order execution types directly supported by backtrader are not enough, in the case of for example Interactive Brokers the following could be passed as kwargs:


orderType='LIT', lmtPrice=10.0, auxPrice=9.8
This would override the settings created by backtrader and generate a LIMIT IF TOUCHED order with a touched price of 9.8 and a limit price of 10.0.

Information Bits:
A Strategy has a length which is always equal to that of the main data (datas[0]) and can of course be gotten with len(self)

next can be called without changes in length if data is being replayed or a live feed is being passed and new ticks for the same point in time (length) are arriving

Member Attributes:
env: the cerebro entity in which this Strategy lives

datas: array of data feeds which have been passed to cerebro

data/data0 is an alias for datas[0]

dataX is an alias for datas[X]

data feeds can also be accessed by name (see the reference) if one has been assigned to it

dnames: an alternative to reach the data feeds by name (either with [name] or with .name notation)

For example if resampling a data like this:


...
data0 = bt.feeds.YahooFinanceData(datname='YHOO', fromdate=..., name='days')
cerebro.adddata(data0)
cerebro.resampledata(data0, timeframe=bt.TimeFrame.Weeks, name='weeks')
...
Later in the strategy one can create indicators on each like this:


...
smadays = bt.ind.SMA(self.dnames.days, period=30)  # or self.dnames['days']
smaweeks = bt.ind.SMA(self.dnames.weeks, period=10)  # or self.dnames['weeks']
...
broker: reference to the broker associated to this strategy (received from cerebro)

stats: list/named tuple-like sequence holding the Observers created by cerebro for this strategy

analyzers: list/named tuple-like sequence holding the Analyzers created by cerebro for this strategy

position: actually a property which gives the current position for data0.

Methods to retrieve all possitions are available (see the reference)

Member Attributes (meant for statistics/observers/analyzers):
_orderspending: list of orders which will be notified to the strategy before next is called

_tradespending: list of trades which will be notified to the strategy before next is called

_orders: list of order which have been already notified. An order can be several times in the list with different statuses and different execution bits. The list is menat to keep the history.

_trades: list of order which have been already notified. A trade can be several times in the list just like an order.

Note

Bear in mind that prenext, nextstart and next can be called several times for the same point in time (ticks updating prices for the daily bar, when a daily timeframe is in use)

Reference: Strategy
class backtrader.Strategy(*args, **kwargs)
Base class to be subclassed for user defined strategies.

next()
This method will be called for all remaining data points when the minimum period for all datas/indicators have been meet.

nextstart()
This method will be called once, exactly when the minimum period for all datas/indicators have been meet. The default behavior is to call next

prenext()
This method will be called before the minimum period of all datas/indicators have been meet for the strategy to start executing

start()
Called right before the backtesting is about to be started.

stop()
Called right before the backtesting is about to be stopped

notify_order(order)
Receives an order whenever there has been a change in one

notify_trade(trade)
Receives a trade whenever there has been a change in one

notify_cashvalue(cash, value)
Receives the current fund value, value status of the strategy’s broker

notify_fund(cash, value, fundvalue, shares)
Receives the current cash, value, fundvalue and fund shares

notify_store(msg, *args, **kwargs)
Receives a notification from a store provider

buy(data=None, size=None, price=None, plimit=None, exectype=None, valid=None, tradeid=0, oco=None, trailamount=None, trailpercent=None, parent=None, transmit=True, **kwargs)
Create a buy (long) order and send it to the broker

data (default: None)

For which data the order has to be created. If None then the first data in the system, self.datas[0] or self.data0 (aka self.data) will be used

size (default: None)

Size to use (positive) of units of data to use for the order.

If None the sizer instance retrieved via getsizer will be used to determine the size.

price (default: None)

Price to use (live brokers may place restrictions on the actual format if it does not comply to minimum tick size requirements)

None is valid for Market and Close orders (the market determines the price)

For Limit, Stop and StopLimit orders this value determines the trigger point (in the case of Limit the trigger is obviously at which price the order should be matched)

plimit (default: None)

Only applicable to StopLimit orders. This is the price at which to set the implicit Limit order, once the Stop has been triggered (for which price has been used)

trailamount (default: None)

If the order type is StopTrail or StopTrailLimit, this is an absolute amount which determines the distance to the price (below for a Sell order and above for a buy order) to keep the trailing stop

trailpercent (default: None)

If the order type is StopTrail or StopTrailLimit, this is a percentage amount which determines the distance to the price (below for a Sell order and above for a buy order) to keep the trailing stop (if trailamount is also specified it will be used)

exectype (default: None)

Possible values:

Order.Market or None. A market order will be executed with the next available price. In backtesting it will be the opening price of the next bar

Order.Limit. An order which can only be executed at the given price or better

Order.Stop. An order which is triggered at price and executed like an Order.Market order

Order.StopLimit. An order which is triggered at price and executed as an implicit Limit order with price given by pricelimit

Order.Close. An order which can only be executed with the closing price of the session (usually during a closing auction)

Order.StopTrail. An order which is triggered at price minus trailamount (or trailpercent) and which is updated if the price moves away from the stop

Order.StopTrailLimit. An order which is triggered at price minus trailamount (or trailpercent) and which is updated if the price moves away from the stop

valid (default: None)

Possible values:

None: this generates an order that will not expire (aka Good till cancel) and remain in the market until matched or canceled. In reality brokers tend to impose a temporal limit, but this is usually so far away in time to consider it as not expiring

datetime.datetime or datetime.date instance: the date will be used to generate an order valid until the given datetime (aka good till date)

Order.DAY or 0 or timedelta(): a day valid until the End of the Session (aka day order) will be generated

numeric value: This is assumed to be a value corresponding to a datetime in matplotlib coding (the one used by backtrader) and will used to generate an order valid until that time (good till date)

tradeid (default: 0)

This is an internal value applied by backtrader to keep track of overlapping trades on the same asset. This tradeid is sent back to the strategy when notifying changes to the status of the orders.

oco (default: None)

Another order instance. This order will become part of an OCO (Order Cancel Others) group. The execution of one of the orders, immediately cancels all others in the same group

parent (default: None)

Controls the relationship of a group of orders, for example a buy which is bracketed by a high-side limit sell and a low side stop sell. The high/low side orders remain inactive until the parent order has been either executed (they become active) or is canceled/expires (the children are also canceled) bracket orders have the same size

transmit (default: True)

Indicates if the order has to be transmitted, ie: not only placed in the broker but also issued. This is meant for example to control bracket orders, in which one disables the transmission for the parent and 1st set of children and activates it for the last children, which triggers the full placement of all bracket orders.

**kwargs: additional broker implementations may support extra parameters. backtrader will pass the kwargs down to the created order objects

Example: if the 4 order execution types directly supported by backtrader are not enough, in the case of for example Interactive Brokers the following could be passed as kwargs:


orderType='LIT', lmtPrice=10.0, auxPrice=9.8
This would override the settings created by backtrader and generate a LIMIT IF TOUCHED order with a touched price of 9.8 and a limit price of 10.0.

Returns

A list containing the 3 orders [order, stop side, limit side]

If high/low orders have been suppressed the return value will still contain 3 orders, but those suppressed will have a value of None

order_target_size(data=None, target=0, **kwargs)
Place an order to rebalance a position to have final size of target

The current position size is taken into account as the start point to achieve target

If target > pos.size -> buy target - pos.size

If target < pos.size -> sell pos.size - target

It returns either:

The generated order
or

None if no order has been issued (target == position.size)
order_target_value(data=None, target=0.0, price=None, **kwargs)
Place an order to rebalance a position to have final value of target

The current value is taken into account as the start point to achieve target

If no target then close postion on data

If target > value then buy on data

If target < value then sell on data

It returns either:

The generated order
or

None if no order has been issued
order_target_percent(data=None, target=0.0, **kwargs)
Place an order to rebalance a position to have final value of target percentage of current portfolio value

target is expressed in decimal: 0.05 -> 5%

It uses order_target_value to execute the order.

Example

target=0.05 and portfolio value is 100

The value to be reached is 0.05 * 100 = 5

5 is passed as the target value to order_target_value

The current value is taken into account as the start point to achieve target

The position.size is used to determine if a position is long / short

If target > value

buy if pos.size >= 0 (Increase a long position)
sell if pos.size < 0 (Increase a short position)
If target < value

sell if pos.size >= 0 (Decrease a long position)
buy if pos.size < 0 (Decrease a short position)
It returns either:

The generated order
or

None if no order has been issued (target == position.size)
getsizer()
Returns the sizer which is in used if automatic statke calculation is used

getsizing(data=None, isbuy=True)
Return the stake calculated by the sizer instance for the current situation

getposition(data=None, broker=None)
Returns the current position for a given data in a given broker.

If both are None, the main data and the default broker will be used

A property position is also available

getpositionbyname(name=None, broker=None)
Returns the current position for a given name in a given broker.

If both are None, the main data and the default broker will be used

A property positionbyname is also available

getpositionsbyname(broker=None)
Returns the current by name positions directly from the broker

If the given broker is None, the default broker will be used

A property positionsbyname is also available

getdatanames()
Returns a list of the existing data names

getdatabyname(name)
Returns a given data by name using the environment (cerebro)

add_timer(when, offset=datetime.timedelta(0), repeat=datetime.timedelta(0), weekdays=[], weekcarry=False, monthdays=[], monthcarry=True, allow=None, tzdata=None, cheat=False, *args, **kwargs)
Note

Can be called during __init__ or start

Schedules a timer to invoke either a specified callback or the notify_timer of one or more strategies.

Parameters

when (-) – can be

datetime.time instance (see below tzdata)

bt.timer.SESSION_START to reference a session start

bt.timer.SESSION_END to reference a session end

offset which must be a datetime.timedelta instance

Used to offset the value when. It has a meaningful use in combination with SESSION_START and SESSION_END, to indicated things like a timer being called 15 minutes after the session start.

repeat which must be a datetime.timedelta instance

Indicates if after a 1st call, further calls will be scheduled within the same session at the scheduled repeat delta

Once the timer goes over the end of the session it is reset to the original value for when

weekdays: a sorted iterable with integers indicating on which days (iso codes, Monday is 1, Sunday is 7) the timers can be actually invoked

If not specified, the timer will be active on all days

weekcarry (default: False). If True and the weekday was not seen (ex: trading holiday), the timer will be executed on the next day (even if in a new week)

monthdays: a sorted iterable with integers indicating on which days of the month a timer has to be executed. For example always on day 15 of the month

If not specified, the timer will be active on all days

monthcarry (default: True). If the day was not seen (weekend, trading holiday), the timer will be executed on the next available day.

allow (default: None). A callback which receives a datetime.date` instance and returns True if the date is allowed for timers or else returns False

tzdata which can be either None (default), a pytz instance or a data feed instance.

None: when is interpreted at face value (which translates to handling it as if it where UTC even if it’s not)

pytz instance: when will be interpreted as being specified in the local time specified by the timezone instance.

data feed instance: when will be interpreted as being specified in the local time specified by the tz parameter of the data feed instance.

Note

If when is either SESSION_START or SESSION_END and tzdata is None, the 1st data feed in the system (aka self.data0) will be used as the reference to find out the session times.

cheat (default False) if True the timer will be called before the broker has a chance to evaluate the orders. This opens the chance to issue orders based on opening price for example right before the session starts

*args: any extra args will be passed to notify_timer

**kwargs: any extra kwargs will be passed to notify_timer

Return Value:

The created timer
notify_timer(timer, when, *args, **kwargs)
Receives a timer notification where timer is the timer which was returned by add_timer, and when is the calling time. args and kwargs are any additional arguments passed to add_timer

The actual when time can be later, but the system may have not be able to call the timer before. This value is the timer value and no the system time.

The code
Strategy with Signals
Operating backtrader is also possible without having to write a Strategy. Although this is the preferred way, due to the object hierarchy which makes up the machinery, using Signals is also possible.

Quick summary:

Instead of writing a Strategy class, instantiating Indicators, writing the buy/sell logic …

The end user add Signals (indicators anyhow) and the rest is done in the background

Quick example:


import backtrader as bt

data = bt.feeds.OneOfTheFeeds(dataname='mydataname')
cerebro.adddata(data)

cerebro.add_signal(bt.SIGNAL_LONGSHORT, MySignal)
cerebro.run()
Et voilá!.

Of course the Signal itself is missing. Let’s define a very dumb Signal which yields:

Long indication if the close price is above a Simple Moving Average

Short indication if the close price is below a Simple Moving Average

The definition:


class MySignal(bt.Indicator):
    lines = ('signal',)
    params = (('period', 30),)

    def __init__(self):
        self.lines.signal = self.data - bt.indicators.SMA(period=self.p.period)
And now it is really done. When run is executed Cerebro will take care of instantiating a special Strategy instance which knows what to do with the Signals.

Initial FAQ
How is the volume of buy/sell operations determined?

A cerebro instance adds automatically a FixedSize sizer to strategies. The end user can change the sizer to alter the policy with cerebro.addsizer

How are orders executed?

The execution type is Market and the validity is Good Until Canceled

Signals technicalities
From a technical and theoretical point of view can be as described:

A callable that returns another object when called (only once)

This is in most cases the instantiation of a class, but must not be

Supports the __getitem__ interface. The only requested key/index will be 0

From a practical point of view and looking at the example above a Signal is:

A lines object from the backtrader ecosystem, mostly an Indicator

This helps when using other Indicators like when in the example the Simple Moving Average is used.

Signals indications
The signals delivers indications when queried with signal[0] and the meaning is:

> 0 -> long indication

< 0 -> short indication

== 0 -> No indication

The example does simple arithmetic with self.data - SMA and:

Issues a long indication when the data is above the SMA

Issues a short indication when the data is below the SMA

Note

When no specific price field is indicated for the data, the close price is the reference price is.

Signals Types
The constants indicated below as seen in the example above, are directly available from the main backtrader module as in:


import backtrader as bt

bt.SIGNAL_LONG
There are 5 types of Signals, broken in 2 groups.

Main Group:

LONGSHORT: both long and short indications from this signal are taken

LONG:

long indications are taken to go long

short indications are taken to close the long position. But:

If a LONGEXIT (see below) signal is in the system it will be used to exit the long

If a SHORT signal is available and no LONGEXIT is available , it will be used to close a long before opening a short

SHORT:

short indications are taken to go short

long indications are taken to close the short position. But:

If a SHORTEXIT (see below) signal is in the system it will be used to exit the short

If a LONG signal is available and no SHORTEXIT is available , it will be used to close a short before opening a long

Exit Group:

This 2 signals are meant to override others and provide criteria for exitins a long / short position

LONGEXIT: short indications are taken to exit long positions

SHORTEXIT: long indications are taken to exit short positions

Accumulation and Order Concurrency
The sample Signal shown above will issue long and short indications on a constant basis, because it simply substracts the SMA value from the close price and this will always be either > 0 and < 0 ( 0 is mathematically possible, but unlikely to really happen)

This would lead to a continuous generation of orders that would produce 2 situations:

Accumulation: even if already in the market, the signals would produce new orders which would increase the possition in the market

Concurrency: new orders would be generated without waiting for the execution of other orders

To avoid this the default behavior is:

To Not Accumulate

To Not allow Concurrency

Should any of these two behaviors be wished, this can be controlled via cerebro with:

cerebro.signal_accumulate(True) (or False to re-disable it)

cerebro.signal_concurrency(True) (or False to re-disable it)

The sample
The backtrader sources contain a sample to test the functionality.

Main signal to be used.


class SMACloseSignal(bt.Indicator):
    lines = ('signal',)
    params = (('period', 30),)

    def __init__(self):
        self.lines.signal = self.data - bt.indicators.SMA(period=self.p.period)
And the Exit Signal in case the option is specified.


class SMAExitSignal(bt.Indicator):
    lines = ('signal',)
    params = (('p1', 5), ('p2', 30),)

    def __init__(self):
        sma1 = bt.indicators.SMA(period=self.p.p1)
        sma2 = bt.indicators.SMA(period=self.p.p2)
        self.lines.signal = sma1 - sma2
First run: long and short

$ ./signals-strategy.py --plot --signal longshort
The output

image

To notice:

The Signal is plotted. This is normal given it is simply an indicator and the plotting rules for it apply

The strategy is really long and short. This can be seen because the cash level never goes back to be the value level

Side note: even for a dumb idea … (and without commission) the strategy hasn’t lost money …

Second run: long only

$ ./signals-strategy.py --plot --signal longonly
The output

image

To notice:

Here the cash level goes back to be the value level after each sell, which means the strategy is out of the market

Side note: Again no money has been lost …

Third run: short only

$ ./signals-strategy.py --plot --signal shortonly
The output

image

To notice:

The 1st operation is a sell as expected and takes place later than the 1st operation in the 2 examples above. Not until the close is below the SMA and the simple substraction yields a minus

Here the cash level goes back to be the value level after each buy, which means the strategy is out of the market

Side note: Finally the system loses money

Fourth run: long + longexit

$ ./signals-strategy.py --plot --signal longonly --exitsignal longexit
The output

image

To notice:

Many of the trades are the same, but some are interrupted earlier because the fast moving average in the exit signal crosses the slow moving average to the downside

The system shows its longonly property with the cash becoming the value at the end of each trade

Side note: Again money is made … even with some modified trades

MA_CrossOver
Alias:


* SMA_CrossOver
This is a long-only strategy which operates on a moving average cross

Note:


* Although the default
Buy Logic:


* No position is open on the data

* The `fast` moving averagecrosses over the `slow` strategy to the
  upside.
Sell Logic:


* A position exists on the data

* The `fast` moving average crosses over the `slow` strategy to the
  downside
Order Execution Type:


* Market
Lines:


* datetime
Params:


* fast (10)

* slow (30)

* _movav (<class ‘backtrader.indicators.sma.SMA’>)
SignalStrategy
This subclass of Strategy is meant to to auto-operate using signals.

Signals are usually indicators and the expected output values:

> 0 is a long indication

< 0 is a short indication

There are 5 types of Signals, broken in 2 groups.

Main Group:

LONGSHORT: both long and short indications from this signal are taken

LONG:

long indications are taken to go long
short indications are taken to close the long position. But:

If a LONGEXIT (see below) signal is in the system it will be used to exit the long

If a SHORT signal is available and no LONGEXIT is available , it will be used to close a long before opening a short

SHORT:

short indications are taken to go short
long indications are taken to close the short position. But:

If a SHORTEXIT (see below) signal is in the system it will be used to exit the short

If a LONG signal is available and no SHORTEXIT is available , it will be used to close a short before opening a long

Exit Group:

This 2 signals are meant to override others and provide criteria for exitins a long/short position

LONGEXIT: short indications are taken to exit long positions

SHORTEXIT: long indications are taken to exit short positions

Order Issuing

Orders execution type is Market and validity is None (Good until Canceled)

Params:

signals (default: []): a list/tuple of lists/tuples that allows the instantiation of the signals and allocation to the right type

This parameter is expected to be managed through cerebro.add_signal

_accumulate (default: False): allow to enter the market (long/short) even if already in the market

_concurrent (default: False): allow orders to be issued even if orders are already pending execution

_data (default: None): if multiple datas are present in the system which is the target for orders. This can be

None: The first data in the system will be used

An int: indicating the data that was inserted at that position

An str: name given to the data when creating it (parameter name) or when adding it cerebro with cerebro.adddata(..., name=)

A data instance

Lines:


* datetime
Params:


* signals ([])

* _accumulate (False)

* _concurrent (False)

* _data (None)
